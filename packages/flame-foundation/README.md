# Flame Foundations

The building blocks for everything related to the Flame design system.

Flame Foundation uses the [system-ui specification](https://system-ui.com/theme/) to build out
the necessary design tokens that will be used within our applications.

## What are `design tokens`?

Design Tokens are an abstraction for everything impacting the visual design of an app/platform.

This includes:

- Colors
- Typography
- Spacing
- Shadows
- Radii
- Transitions

Those can eventually be reused for multiple platforms (Web, iOS, Android, etc.)

Some references on the subject:

- [Salesforce UX - Design Tokens](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/wiki/Design-Tokens)

## What should be included here?

Core foundational values SHOULD be added here.

DO NOT add styling or variants for primitive components (such as buttons and links), as their respective component library should be the responsible for their implementation.
