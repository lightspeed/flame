# Flame Foundations

The building blocks for everything related to the Flame design system.

Flame Foundation uses the [theme-ui specification](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec) to build out
the necessary design tokens that will be used within our applications.

## What are `design tokens`?

Design Tokens are an abstraction for everything impacting the visual design of an app/platform.

This includes:

- [Colors](#colors)
- [Typography](#typography)
- [Spacing](#spacing)
- [Shadows](#shadows)
- [Radii](#radii)
- [Transitions](#transitions)

Those can eventually be reused for multiple platforms (Web, iOS, Android, etc.)
