## Sizes

Our buttons come in four different sizes: Small, Medium, Large & Extra Large. All buttons have a fixed height and padding unless stated differently inside the type

| Size     | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `small`  | These little buttons are used in compact little spaces, e.g. inside the header of a card.                                                                                                                         |
| `medium` | Default size of the Button                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `large`  | The large button is mainly used inside an open but content-rich page with multiple actions. This large button also provides a large touchable area for use on touch screens.                                      |
| `xlarge` | When a single page has nothing going on but to promote a single thing with just one button, you should use the extra large button. This button is also great for fast pacing flows with a focus on touch screens. |

## Styles

These are all the styles that are included in all button types (unless stated differently in the types section).

| Style               | Usage                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default`/`neutral` | The neutral button is used for all generic actions.                                                     |
| `primary`           | There should only be one main action on the page. This action should always be a primary styled button. |
| `secondary`         | For subsequent actions that encourage our users to fill data like selecting a product.                  |
| `danger`            | For all actions that can be destructive, we use the danger styled button.                               |
